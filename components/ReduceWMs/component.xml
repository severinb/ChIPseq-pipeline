    <doc>
      This component tries to narrow down the candidate WM set (from phylogibbs, from motevo refinement, given WMs).
      It sorts WMs by a given score (AUC if you give log_file of WMQuality component or likelihood of sequences if you given log_file of ComputeLikelihood component).
      Then it goes down the list, keeping just WMs that do not look very similar.
      Similarity of two WMs is defined by the convolution at their optimal relative position. Similarity score is computed to a distance.
      From WMs that have smaller distance to each other than given distance_cutoff just the one WM with highest AUC or likelihood score resp. is given out. 
      The purpose of this is to have less candidate WMs to do the downstream analysis.
